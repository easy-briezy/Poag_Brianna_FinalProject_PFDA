## Repository:

## Description
    A simple dress up game made with pygame and pillow. This project is relevant to digital media because it is a visual interactive game utilizing digital images.


## Features

    - player chooses designs
        - the player will have pre-made attributes to choose from and after clicking on their choice the doll design will change. depending what the palyer clicks it will input different images into a function that will place the image into the player screen on to the character.

        image choices could be in a list and the the icons could have an assigned number for items in the list.


    - Character Attributes as png:
        - I'll make different attributes like 3 simple hair styles, and a few outfits that are just those objects by themselves in a png using a drawing software. I'll import the images into the final project folder.

        will likeley use pillow to place images on top of the base doll image.

    - Music
        - will import a python library for music (unless pyagame already has function for that). Copyright free music for the game.

## Challenges
    - creating a game layout with clickable icons that activate a function when clicked. 
    - The player using the mouse. 
    - creating an exit for the game

## Outcomes
    Ideal outcome:
        The player will have icons of choices and will be able to  click and choose the doll's appearance. The player will have 2-3 choices in categoriez like hair, skin complexion, and clothes. It would be nice if the player could also pick from different color options for the hair and clothes. 

        when the player makes a choice a new/different png image will go onto the base doll image.
    
       -  additionally if I can have the game to have music/sound effects that would be nice.
       - other additional if the player could save their doll design out as an image for them to be able to keep.
    

    Minimum outcome:
      Player will be given choices on how they want the doll character to look and the doll will change in appearance based on their choices. at simplest form thge player input would be typed. the character will have at least on customizable attribute like either hair or clothes
